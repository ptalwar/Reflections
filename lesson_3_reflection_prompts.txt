Q1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
A1.    During collaboration with other users and for sharing my awesome projects with the world.

Q2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A2. Just like i want to make my commits manually and push them to GitHub manually having made logical changes, i'd like
to pull changes from GitHub to my local repo manually so i know exactly what am incorporating into my local repo.

Q3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

A3. forks are cpoies of a repo remotely, clones are copies of a repo both locally & remotely and braches are
copies of the master branch to a certain period in time.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
